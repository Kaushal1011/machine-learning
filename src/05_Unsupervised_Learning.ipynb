    "- Clustering: the goal is to group similar instances together into clusters. This is a great tool for data analysis, customer segmentation, recommender systems, search engines, image segmentation, semi-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and more. \n",
    "- Anomaly detection: the objective is to learn what “normal” data looks like, and use this to detect abnormal instances, such as defective items on a production line or a new trend in a time series.\n",
    "- Density estimation: this is the task of estimating the probability density function (PDF) of the random process that generated the dataset. This is commonly used for anomaly detection: instances located in very low-density regions are likely to be anomalies. It is also useful for data analysis and visualization.\n",
