    "“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for either classification or regression problems. However, it is mostly used in classification. In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is the number of features you have) called support vectors. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyperplane that differentiates the two classes. Additionally, SVM is robust to outliers and has a feature to ignore them.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM constructs a hyperplane in multidimensional space to separate different classes. SVM generates optimal hyperplane in an iterative manner, which is used to minimize an error. The core idea of SVM is to find a maximum marginal hyperplane(MMH) that best divides the dataset into classes.\n",
